\wgPoll{We should introduce a \std\code{simd} namespace in P1928 (realizing
    that this would mean we potentially have a type whose fully-qualified name is
    \std\code{simd::simd} and would involve removing “simd” from
  \code{basic_simd_mask}) and remove the \code{simd_} prefix from utilities moved
into that namespace which currently have that prefix.}
