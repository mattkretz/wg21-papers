\begin{wgTitlepage}
  There is one important constant in SIMD programming: \code{{0, 1, 2, 3,
  ...}}. In the standard library we have an algorithm called \code{iota} that
  can initialize a range with such values. For \code{simd} we want to have
  simple to spell constants that scale with the SIMD width. This paper proposes
  a simple facility that can be generalized.

\section{Relation to list-initialization of \code{simd}}
If we add a constructor to \simd that enables list-initialization, then many
users might use that in place of a generator constructor.
This leads to code that doesn't scale with the vector width anymore.
Therefore we should provide a simple facility that is concise and
portable\footnote{in terms of SIMD width}.

\section{Behavior on overflow}\label{sec:overflow}
Consider \code{iota<simd<char, 512>>} where \code{is_signed_v<char>} is
\code{true}.
While the standard only requires support of \simd width up to 64,
implemenations are still free to enable larger widths.
Should this be ill-formed (Mandates vs. Constraint) or should it match
\code{std::iota} and \code{std::ranges::iota} behavior and produce a sawtooth
wave?

I was using \stdsimd\code{iota} in test code and encountered both cases.
In one case I had an error in my test code and making it ill-formed helped fixing the problem.
In another case I was comparing against memory intitialized by \code{std::iota}
and making \stdsimd\code{iota} ill-formed unnecessarily made my test cases harder
to write.

Granted, most people won't use \stdsimd\code{iota} in order to compare it against
\std\code{iota}.
Instead, the most likely use will be as a sequence of increasing offsets.
In that case wraparound introduces a bug, and potentially even out-of-bounds
indexes leading to memory-safety issues.
Therefore, I prefer making \stdsimd\code{iota} ill-formed if the \simd width is
larger than the largest representable number.
In terms of helpful diagnostics, a “Mandates” clause is the better solution.
The wording below implements it that way.
