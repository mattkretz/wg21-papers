\item Add a simple example to the motivation section.
\item Expand the “Generalization” section to clearly define the feature rather

\item Discuss why reusing the existing \code{iota} algorithm/view does not
  work/suffice for the \code{simd} use case.
\item Discuss why \code{iota_v} is the right name.
