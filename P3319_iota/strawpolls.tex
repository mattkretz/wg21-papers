\wgPoll{We want the variable template that creates an iota sequence described in the paper for \code{basic_simd} and arithmetic scalars.}
{6 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0}

\wgPoll{The iota facility should be generalized to any sequence of static extent.}
{0 & 0 & 4 & 3 & 1}

\wgPoll{Assuming the author provides wording and a wording expert verifies that it matches design intent, forward P3319R1 to LEWG for inclusion in C++26.}
{6 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0}
